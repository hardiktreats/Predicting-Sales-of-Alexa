# Predicting-Sales-of-Alexa
This code is a Python script that uses several libraries, including numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and sklearn, to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks. The script reads data from a CSV file named 'Alexa_dataset.csv' and stores it in a variable named Dataset. The data is then split into features (X) and labels (y) using the iloc method of the pandas DataFrame.

The data is then split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The training data is then standardized using the StandardScaler class from the sklearn.preprocessing module.

The script then trains a k-nearest neighbors classifier on the training data using the KNeighborsClassifier class from the sklearn.neighbors module. The classifier is configured to use 5 neighbors, the Minkowski distance metric, and a value of 2 for the power parameter.

The trained classifier is then used to make predictions on the test data, and the accuracy, precision, and recall of the classifier are calculated using the accuracy_score, precision_score, and recall_score functions from the sklearn.metrics module.

The script also defines a function named Visualizer that takes two arguments and uses them to create a visualization of the data using the matplotlib library. The function creates a contour plot of the decision boundary of the classifier and also plots the training or test data points on top of it.

Overall, this code appears to be performing a classification task on some data using a k-nearest neighbors classifier. It also calculates several performance metrics for the classifier and creates visualizations of the data and decision boundary.
